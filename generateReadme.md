  To be used on any device by anyone who wants to learn more about stocks and keep up to date information about different stocks.
  
  # Contributing
  I helped provided functionality to the API and helped work on the CSS and styling of the project.
  
  # Tests
  Ensure that the API and local storage is working correctly by ensuring the information is being pulled up from the API and can be saved to the user's "favorite's" section.
